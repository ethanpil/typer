# typer
Plain text editor for modern browsers. Intended for use with Safe Exam Browser.

Typer was developed as a simple, no frills text editor intended for use by students taking a test on the computer. There are no formatting tools, no alignment tools and no extra features. Typer is designed for intuitive typing of text without any confusion or distraction.

Typer is intended to be used with [Safe Exam Browser](https://www.safeexambrowser.org). When used in conjunction with Safe Exam Browser, students will not have access to spell check, nor will they be able to open other windows or applications. They can work solely on the text at hand. 

## Configuration
There is no configuration required. Typer is a single, static HTML file which can be hosted for free on any number of hosts, including GitHub and Netlify.

## Usage
Simply point your browser to the URL containing Typer and you are ready to type. You can use it directly from GitHub via [Staticaly CDN](https://www.staticaly.com/) via this link: [Typer Demo](https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/ethanpil/typer/3eec9a50/typer.html)
